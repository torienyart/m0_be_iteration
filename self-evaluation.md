# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
    I felt good, I seemed to pick it up pretty quickly.  It's cool that you can use an if/else statement within an each method.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
    I think that it felt pretty intuitive actually.  I felt set up for success!

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    I think it would be helpful to know the correct terms for what things are methods/commands/statements... etc.  I get a little bit confused on the difference sometimes!  I will add an extra hour or so to go over my notes on the vocabulary!

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
